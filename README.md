# Final Project

Our final project is an entertainment page. Users can register and login.

As our page is for entertainment, we have added 4 different games developed in JavaScript. Memory game, Find the treasure, Drawing and an incredible game to play the piano.

The project has the API "Open Wheater" where users can write the name of the city, once the information has been sent, the name of the city is saved in the database and then displayed on the screen (more details in the video ).

The project was built using Django as a backend framework. All generated information are saved in database (SQLite by default).

All webpages of the project are mobile-responsive.
